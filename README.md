# React Tic Tac Toe

For **SEI 713** this is a week-long deliverable, **due Monday, August 31**.

Follow the [React tic tac toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)!

You'll notice there are two options for setup that the tutorial offers. Do **Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment**. Make the project a github repo and commit as you go.

## How to submit:

## Write a brief reflection on what you learned from this tutorial here:  

 I learned about that React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and understanding how different components works 

 ## Different types of components

 * Functional component
    
    A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
    Less code and easier to read.


* Class component

    A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. This requires more code but will also give you some benefits which you will see later on.
