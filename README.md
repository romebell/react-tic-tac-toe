## Write a brief reflection on what you learned from this tutorial here:

This was actually pretty fun to create, especially because I had struggled doing the tic tac toe javascript. This was nice to learn more about because I learned knew concepts like useHistory(). I didn't think it would be possible to go to your previous moves. It gives me a better insight of how to use useState, but I still need more practice.
