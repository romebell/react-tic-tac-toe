## Write a brief reflection on what you learned from this tutorial here:
I learned how to properly pass props from one component to the next. I found it interesting that, when we started, most of the information was happening in the Square and Board components, but by the end, the bulk of the work was happening in the Game component, the highest "parent" component. Having the ability to useState lets us save each moment in time that occurs in the game ( or in a react app ), giving the ability to return to previous moments {using history}. I also learned that it is totally normal to start with more information in spread out components, but by the end, one or two components are doing most of the work ( api calls, passing props, routing etc.). I really enjoyed getting to build tic-tac-toe again and I think it helped cement my understanding of state. It also furthered my comfort level when using class based components as opposed to functional components.
